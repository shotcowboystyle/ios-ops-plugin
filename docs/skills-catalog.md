# Skill catalog

This catalog explains the purpose, feature set, and handoff for every role-oriented package in the BishopTech iOS 26 Skills Lab.

The packages are not generic “write some Swift” prompts. Each role is expected to inspect the real project, consult the relevant official Apple or Swift sources, preserve availability and entitlement gates, state uncertainty, and return evidence that another role can verify.

## Shared handoff contract

Every role should return:

- the user-visible claim and highest-consequence failure;
- project, target, SDK, OS, device, entitlement, permission, account, and data facts;
- official sources and version-sensitive assumptions;
- files inspected and files changed;
- outputs for the next role;
- tests, fixtures, and evidence level;
- what the result proves;
- what it does not prove;
- the smallest next gate.

## Evidence levels

Use these labels consistently:

| Level | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Source | Apple or Swift documentation was checked. |
| Target/static | Project files, targets, entitlements, privacy resources, or configuration were inspected. |
| Compile | Code typechecked or built against a named SDK and target. |
| Fixture/unit | Deterministic logic passed controlled fixtures. |
| Simulator/UI | A simulator or UI automation workflow passed. |
| Physical/system | A named device, accessory, assistive technology, or system host was tested. |
| Account/server | A required service, account, server, or provider behavior was verified. |
| Signed artifact | Archive, signing, entitlements, versions, and target membership were inspected. |
| TestFlight/App Store | A real distribution or review path was exercised. |
| Production | The shipped environment and affected operation were verified. |

The levels are cumulative only when the task requires them. A higher-looking artifact does not erase a missing device, account, accessibility, privacy, or production check.

## Package anatomy

Each role package keeps the main SKILL.md short and routes detail to one-level references:

1. trigger and role scope;
2. read-before-acting checklist;
3. role workflow;
4. output contract;
5. hard boundaries;
6. official Sources;
7. focused references, fixtures, or audit matrices.

The package archive should contain only the intended skill files. It must not include secrets, user data, private workspace paths, generated test output, or claims that are not reviewable.

# iOS 26 Skills Lab

> Turn an LLM into a disciplined Apple-native engineering team.

An official-source-grounded knowledge base and portable skill bundle for building high-quality iOS apps with Swift, SwiftUI, Liquid Glass, Apple Intelligence, on-device AI, the wider Apple SDK, and Meta Wearables companion/display experiences.

## The short version

Most AI coding workflows jump from an idea to a code snippet. This lab makes the missing engineering work explicit: capability selection, target and availability gates, native composition, privacy, AI evaluation, accessibility, physical-device proof, signing, and release evidence.

It is designed to help a solo developer work like a small, specialized Apple engineering team while keeping source claims, uncertainty, and proof requirements visible.

## Verified scale

| 1,007 | 976 | 3,081 | 19 | 19 |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| source-linked Markdown files | content pages | official Apple / Swift destinations | role packages | portable `.skill` artifacts |

The verified scale above is the original Apple lane. The Meta extension currently adds 30 route/source pages, twenty-three role packages, focused evaluation fixtures, and twenty-three portable `.skill` artifacts; it is tracked separately so the Apple baseline remains reproducible.

The orchestrator and every specialist package use the same handoff vocabulary: what was inspected, what the result proves, what it does not prove, and the smallest next gate.

## Choose your first route

| Your task | Start here | What you get |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Turn an app idea into a build plan | [Agentic Apple engineering team](knowledge-base/skills/packages/ios-agentic-apple-engineering-team/SKILL.md) | Role routing, source gates, handoffs, risks, and next action |
| Choose the right framework, target, or extension | [Apple SDK route](knowledge-base/skills/packages/apple-sdk-route/SKILL.md) | Capability matrix, lifecycle ownership, availability, permissions, and fallback |
| Make the UI feel native and adaptive | [SwiftUI native design](knowledge-base/skills/packages/swiftui-native-design/SKILL.md) | Screen states, navigation, Dynamic Type, accessibility, and preview coverage |
| Build restrained, functional Liquid Glass | [Liquid Glass design](knowledge-base/skills/packages/liquid-glass-design/SKILL.md) | Material roles, action hierarchy, transitions, reduced-effects fallback, and device review |
| Add private, reviewable on-device AI | [On-device AI feature](knowledge-base/skills/packages/on-device-ai-feature/SKILL.md) | Typed proposals, model readiness, refusal, user review, deterministic commits, and evaluation |
| Test, audit, and ship the real app | [Testing and release assurance](knowledge-base/skills/packages/ios-testing-and-release-assurance/SKILL.md) | Swift Testing, UI, accessibility, performance, device, archive, and TestFlight gates |
| Build an iOS + Meta Wearables experience | [Meta Wearables agentic team](knowledge-base/skills/packages/meta-wearables-agentic-team/SKILL.md) | Exact upstream-role roster, DAT/Web App route selection, camera/audio, Display/input/sensors, device proof, privacy, and source refresh |

## The evidence ladder

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    source["Source"] --> target["Target / static"]
    target --> compile["Compile"]
    compile --> fixture["Fixture / unit"]
    fixture --> simulator["Simulator / UI"]
    simulator --> physical["Physical / system"]
    physical --> signed["Signed artifact"]
    signed --> distribution["TestFlight / App Store"]
    distribution --> production["Production"]
```

These levels are not a vanity score. A simulator run does not establish accessory behavior; an archive does not establish accessibility; a model response does not establish correctness; a TestFlight upload does not establish production behavior. Use only the levels a claim actually requires.

## Meta Wearables extension team (23 packages)

The Meta lane is a source-grounded extension for native iOS and Android companion apps using the [Meta Wearables Device Access Toolkit](https://github.com/facebook/meta-wearables-dat-ios) and [DAT Android](https://github.com/facebook/meta-wearables-dat-android), plus separate [Ray-Ban Display Web Apps](https://wearables.developer.meta.com/docs/develop/webapps). It keeps DAT, native Display, Web Apps, MockDevice/browser simulation, and physical-glasses evidence distinct. The current public source snapshot does not establish a runtime mapping for “Gen 3”; use the exact `DeviceType`, capability response, firmware, and hardware result.

- [Meta Wearables debugging and observability](knowledge-base/skills/packages/meta-wearables-debugging-observability/SKILL.md) — diagnose the first DAT failure through read-only live evidence and produce redacted diagnostic handoffs.
- [Meta Wearables input and sensors](knowledge-base/skills/packages/meta-wearables-input-sensors/SKILL.md) — keep native Display, Web App D-pad/EMG/temple input, browser/phone sensors, event epochs, privacy, and named-target proof distinct.
- [Meta Wearables security and attestation](knowledge-base/skills/packages/meta-wearables-security-attestation/SKILL.md) — keep iOS/Android identity tuples, callbacks, attestation, Developer Mode, release channels, package/signing secrets, and processing/review claims distinct.
- [Meta Wearables device compatibility](knowledge-base/skills/packages/meta-wearables-device-compatibility/SKILL.md) — resolve product labels, DAT/artifact revisions, firmware/companion tuples, version-dependency access, Gen 2 evidence, and Gen 3/regular-SDK uncertainty.

- [Meta Wearables implementation recipes](knowledge-base/skills/packages/meta-wearables-implementation-recipes/SKILL.md) — turn selected API rows and playbooks into source-aligned Swift, Kotlin/Java, and Web App scaffolding with compile/privacy/fallback gates.
- [Meta Wearables source refresh](knowledge-base/skills/packages/meta-wearables-source-refresh/SKILL.md) — maintain release, API, device, and access freshness.

Portable Meta artifacts are listed in the [workspace package index](knowledge-base/skills/packages/README.md).

## Give an LLM a real brief

Start the orchestrator with facts instead of a vague “build me an app” prompt:

```text
App idea:
Primary user and highest-consequence failure:
Target platforms and minimum OS:
Required Apple capabilities:
Data, privacy, account, and network boundaries:
On-device AI role, if any:
Known physical devices, accessories, and system surfaces:
Current project files, targets, schemes, and tests:
Desired evidence level:
```

Ask for a route decision, official sources, availability gates, implementation plan, test matrix, device/release proof plan, open uncertainties, and the smallest next verifiable step.

## Source and safety boundary

The material paraphrases and routes official Apple and Swift documentation. It is not a replacement for SDK headers, Xcode diagnostics, current Apple Developer documentation, Human Interface Guidelines, legal advice, or actual device, account, App Store, or production evidence.

The project is review-ready, not approval-guaranteed. Apple platform behavior, availability, entitlements, privacy rules, hardware support, and release policies can change. Refresh the cited source and installed SDK before relying on a version-sensitive route.

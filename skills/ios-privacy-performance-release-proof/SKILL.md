# iOS Privacy, Performance, and Release Proof

Use this skill to turn an iOS feature claim into a traceable privacy, test, performance, accessibility, system-surface, and release-evidence plan. Inspect the real target before recommending configuration, and keep every evidence layer separate.

## Read before acting

- Inspect the `.xcodeproj`/`.xcworkspace`, schemes, test plans, targets, deployment target, SDK/toolchain, build configurations, Info.plist values, entitlements, capabilities, bundle identifiers, package dependencies, extensions, and supported device families.
- Read the [framework availability and device-proof matrix](../../knowledge-base/40-framework-routes/08-framework-availability-and-device-matrix.md), [source-review checklist](../../knowledge-base/60-verification/00-source-review-checklist.md), [build/device/release checklist](../../knowledge-base/60-verification/01-build-device-and-release-checklist.md), [accessibility checklist](../../knowledge-base/60-verification/02-accessibility-and-adaptability-checklist.md), [AI evaluation checklist](../../knowledge-base/60-verification/03-ai-evaluation-and-safety-checklist.md), and [system-surface checklist](../../knowledge-base/60-verification/05-system-surface-checklist.md).
- Refresh the exact [official source registry](../../knowledge-base/sources/official-source-registry.md) and current Apple pages before making an API, availability, policy, or App Store claim.

## Evidence ladder

Record the strongest level actually observed:

| Level | Can support | Cannot support alone |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Official source | Documented API behavior, constraints, availability language, or policy requirement | This target’s configuration, compilation, permission state, user experience, or release behavior |
| Static target inspection | Target membership, bundle resources, build settings, entitlements, and intended route | A successful build, valid signing, device behavior, or system delivery |
| Compile/unit/fixture test | API compatibility and deterministic domain behavior | Hardware, protected services, model quality, accessibility ergonomics, APNs, or production state |
| Preview/simulator/UI test | Layout, fixtures, navigation, and selected automatable flows | Physical sensors, VoiceOver/Voice Control/Switch Control behavior, thermal state, paired devices, or production services |
| Physical debug device | Hardware, permission, assistive technology, system surface, and device lifecycle behavior | Distribution metadata, TestFlight processing, App Review, or production server health |
| Signed archive/TestFlight | Packaging, signing, entitlements, store-like build, and beta behavior | App Review approval, live production rollout, all devices/regions, or server reliability |
| Production evidence | The tested live route/environment | Universal behavior across OS versions, devices, accounts, languages, or future SDKs |

Never write “works,” “private,” “accessible,” “fast,” or “release-ready” without naming the target, OS, device, build/configuration, environment, operation, and evidence level.

## Fast path

Run change-impact triage across privacy, required-reason APIs, performance, accessibility, artifact integrity, and distribution. Execute only the affected evidence lanes, capture a baseline and delta, and reserve a full release audit for changes that cross a release or system boundary.

## Workflow

### 1. Convert the claim into an operation

Write the observable operation first: create a privacy report, resolve an App Entity, render a widget after reload, complete a VoiceOver task, measure a scroll hitch, receive a MetricKit report, archive a Release build, install a TestFlight build, or submit an App Store package. Identify what success and failure look like.

### 2. Map configuration and data boundaries

- Record the deployment target, SDK, device family, target membership, extension membership, capabilities, entitlements, usage descriptions, privacy resources, package/SDK versions, account state, server/APNs environment, model/language assets, and supported regions.
- Decide whether `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` belongs to the app, framework, static/dynamic SDK, widget, or extension target. Add it to the owning bundle resources and inspect the built artifact.
- Trace actual data collection, retention, tracking, linkage, remote processing, and third-party SDK behavior. Reconcile `NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypes`, `NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypes`, App Store Connect App Privacy, privacy-policy URLs, permission copy, and observed network behavior.
- For every required-reason API category, use only Apple’s current approved `NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypeReasons` values. Do not use a manifest to authorize tracking, and do not make the app manifest stand in for an SDK’s own manifest.

### 3. Choose the test route

- Use Swift Testing for deterministic unit/integration behavior with suites, traits, and parameterized inputs; use XCTest/XCUIAutomation for UI, system interaction, accessibility audits, and performance tests.
- Inspect the active `.xctestplan`: targets, included/excluded tags, configurations, diagnostics policy, destinations, and command. Create separate focused-development and pre-submission plans when their coverage or runtime differs.
- Include negative states: denied/restricted, unavailable, stale/missing record, locked device, offline, canceled, interrupted, terminated process, extension expiration, model-not-ready, language asset missing, duplicate event, and migration failure.
- Inspect the result bundle and identify skipped/excluded tests; a green plan proves only the tests and configurations it actually ran.

### 4. Measure without leaking data

- Use `Logger` with reverse-DNS subsystem/category names for actionable diagnostics. Redact prompts, model output, images, audio, health/contact data, credentials, tokens, and unnecessary identifiers.
- Use `OSSignposter` intervals/events with stable names and per-operation IDs for Instruments timelines. Record the workload, warm/cold state, device, OS, build, and measurement tool.
- Use XCTest performance metrics for controlled regressions, including hitch, clock, memory, and signpost measurements where relevant. Define a baseline and an acceptable change; never turn one run into a universal guarantee.
- Use MetricKit for system-collected reports from real devices. For an iOS 26 deployment target, verify the SDK/API availability before selecting the route: Apple documents `MXMetricManager` for iOS 13+, while current documentation describes the Swift-first `MetricManager` async-sequence API for iOS 27 and later. Add availability/fallback handling rather than compiling a future-only symbol unconditionally.
- Treat debug Instruments traces, XCTest baselines, real-device daily MetricKit payloads, and product-wide performance claims as different evidence classes.

### 5. Run accessibility and system-surface tasks

- Create a task matrix for launch, empty, success, edit, error, destructive, settings, deep link, notification, and recovery flows.
- Test VoiceOver, Voice Control, Switch Control, Assistive Access, Dynamic Type, increased contrast, reduced transparency, Reduce Motion, captions/transcripts, localization/RTL, keyboard, pointer, and controller input as supported by the target. Use physical devices for assistive technologies Apple documents as unavailable in Simulator.
- Test widgets, controls, App Intents, Shortcuts, Spotlight, Live Activities, notifications, extensions, Watch, CarPlay, App Clips, and share/file destinations from the real system or host surface. Include terminated, locked/restricted, stale, offline, and permission-revoked states.
- Treat accessibility audits, previews, system discovery, and a rendered system surface as diagnostic/layout evidence; they do not prove task completion, action side effects, or release delivery.

### 6. Verify the signed release path

1. Build and test the intended Release configuration.
2. Inspect the archive’s bundle IDs, version/build, entitlements, embedded extensions, privacy manifests, usage descriptions, symbols, and device-family metadata.
3. Generate/review the archive privacy report and reconcile App Store Connect App Privacy, metadata, claims, accessibility declarations, and privacy-policy URLs.
4. Validate/distribute through the intended TestFlight/App Store path and record processing/upload results.
5. Exercise the actual signed build on representative physical devices and real system surfaces.
6. Record APNs/server/account/storefront/capability state separately from local evidence.
7. Report what remains unproven: App Review, production rollout, all devices, all locales, or future OS behavior.

Do not include secrets, raw model prompts/responses, health/contact/call payloads, private tokens, or unnecessary user media in the report. Redact logs and screenshots.

## Hard boundaries

- Never call a privacy manifest, accessibility audit, performance baseline, archive, or TestFlight upload a universal privacy, accessibility, speed, approval, or production guarantee.
- Never print credentials, sensitive payloads, or unnecessary identifiers while collecting diagnostics or release evidence.
- Never add tracking, remote processing, broad permissions, or release metadata merely to make a check pass; record the missing boundary instead.

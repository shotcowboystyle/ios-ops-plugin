# Agentic Apple engineering team

Act as the technical lead for a small, evidence-driven Apple engineering team.
Turn a user outcome into a narrow native route, coordinate specialist passes,
and return implementation-ready direction with source links, tests, audit
findings, and honest evidence gaps. This skill is an orchestrator, not a
generic code generator and not a promise of Apple approval.

`outcome -> intake -> source scout -> route architect -> native designer -> implementer -> test/evaluation -> security/privacy audit -> device/release audit -> source refresh -> handoff`

## Read before acting

- Inspect the actual repository, Xcode project/workspace, targets, schemes,
  deployment targets, platforms, modules, extensions, capabilities,
  `Info.plist`, privacy manifest, persistence, network, assets, and tests.
- Read the [knowledge-base map](../../knowledge-base/README.md), the [capability-first SDK
  atlas](../../knowledge-base/40-framework-routes/10-capability-first-apple-sdk-atlas.md),
  the [availability and device-proof matrix](../../knowledge-base/40-framework-routes/08-framework-availability-and-device-matrix.md),
  and only the relevant deep dives, design routes, recipes, and proof matrix.
- Refresh the exact official Apple/Swift sources before relying on a symbol,
  availability annotation, entitlement, system surface, HIG rule, or iOS 26
  behavior. Treat the installed SDK headers and Xcode diagnostics as a second
  authority for the target being built.
- Load the specialist package that matches the work; use the [role routing
  reference](../../.agent/skills/ios-agentic-apple-engineering-team/references/role-routing.md), [quality-gate reference](../../.agent/skills/ios-agentic-apple-engineering-team/references/quality-gates.md),
  and [evaluation fixtures](../../.agent/skills/ios-agentic-apple-engineering-team/references/evaluation-fixtures.md) when judging
  whether the bundle behaves precisely enough to publish.

## Team operating model

If delegated agents are available, assign the roles below with explicit inputs,
allowed files, verification commands, and stop conditions. Permit at most one
implementation writer at a time. Parallelize read-only source research and
independent test/audit analysis only when their outputs do not race. If
delegation is unavailable, perform the same passes sequentially and label each
pass in the receipt.

1. **Intake lead:** state the user outcome, entry point, primary action,
   consequence, supported targets, privacy sensitivity, and non-goals.
2. **Source scout:** refresh primary Apple/Swift pages and installed headers;
   record API, target, hardware, entitlement, permission, region, model, and
   extension gates.
3. **Route architect:** choose the narrowest native frameworks and concrete
   symbols; name rejected alternatives and draw source -> observation ->
   validation -> domain truth -> UI/system handoff.
4. **Native designer:** shape SwiftUI hierarchy, navigation, controls, motion,
   Liquid Glass grouping, Dynamic Type, localization, alternate input, and
   reduced-effects fallbacks without copying Apple-owned screens or branding.
5. **Implementer:** change only the requested target and directly related
   state/tests; preserve user copy/assets/scope; make lifecycle and cancellation
   explicit; keep generated output out of domain truth.
6. **Test/evaluation lead:** write deterministic fixtures and Swift Testing,
   XCTest/XCUIAutomation, accessibility, performance, model-evaluation, and
   integration checks appropriate to the route.
7. **Security/privacy auditor:** inspect trust boundaries, Keychain/CryptoKit,
   server authority, data minimization, privacy manifest/usage descriptions,
   logs, redaction, permissions, entitlements, and recovery.
8. **Device/release auditor:** separate simulator, physical-device,
   two-device/accessory/system-surface, signed archive, TestFlight, App Store,
   and production evidence; inspect the actual artifact.
9. **Source maintainer:** recheck official URLs and installed SDK interfaces,
   classify availability/deprecation drift, update affected routes/recipes/
   package references, and record the refresh receipt.
10. **Lead judge:** reject unsupported claims, reconcile findings, and produce a
    next-action list with the smallest safe follow-up.

## Fast path

Select roles in proportion to risk instead of running the entire team for every change:

- Local UI or deterministic state: intake, route, design, implement, and test.
- Protected data, cross-target, system-hosted, AI, or release work: add only the specialist lanes that own those gates.
- Give every selected role the same handoff packet, stop after the smallest slice passes its next gate, and escalate only for an open risk or evidence boundary.

## Route workflow

1. Record a one-sentence outcome and an explicit consequence of failure.
2. Classify the route: native UI, data/persistence, media/ML, protected data,
   communication, accessory/peer, system surface, background/extension,
   commerce/identity/security, spatial/graphics/game, or release work.
3. Select the narrowest Apple route and verify current availability. Prefer
   standard SwiftUI/UIKit/system controls and Apple-owned surfaces before custom
   infrastructure or visual imitation.
4. Build a state matrix before the happy path: unsupported, denied, restricted,
   unavailable, not-ready, loading, partial, stale, interrupted, cancelled,
   expired, empty, invalid, conflict, retry, and completed as applicable.
5. List target configuration: deployment target, device family, entitlements,
   usage descriptions, background modes, App Groups, associated domains,
   server/account setup, model/assets, region, and extension targets.
6. Design the native screen and system handoff. Use Liquid Glass only for a
   functional related group; keep hierarchy, contrast, accessibility, and a
   non-glass fallback intact.
7. Implement the smallest reversible slice with an explicit source revision,
   request/task epoch, cancellation path, and stale-result guard.
8. Run the proportional test/audit/device/release passes. Do not promote a
   compile, preview, simulator run, AI proposal, archive, or system callback to
   a stronger evidence level.
9. Return the standard handoff below and identify the next smallest proof gap.

## Output contract

Use this structure for substantial work; adapt it only when the task is tiny:

```text
# Apple engineering handoff

Outcome:
Selected route:
Rejected alternatives:
Target/configuration gates:
State and lifecycle contract:
Data/trust boundary:
Native UI and Liquid Glass decisions:
On-device AI boundary:
Files changed:
Tests and commands:
Evidence by level:
Known gaps and unverified claims:
Next smallest action:
```

Every claim in the handoff should identify its evidence level: source, compile,
fixture/unit, UI/simulator, physical/system, server/account, signed artifact,
TestFlight/App Store, or production. Link to the exact official source nearest
to version-sensitive claims.

## Hard boundaries

- Do not call a framework callback, generated proposal, sensor value, model
  output, permission result, credential object, transaction token, or system
  entity domain truth without the route’s deterministic validation and review.
- Do not add a backend, account, analytics, cloud sync, health access,
  background mode, paid service, entitlement, or production credential without
  a stated product need and authorization.
- Do not copy Apple-owned screens, branding, icons, wording, or proprietary
  visual identity. Use native conventions with original hierarchy and copy.
- Do not expose secrets or raw personal/protected data to model context, logs,
  crash fixtures, source control, or UI.
- Do not claim Apple approval. “Apple-conforming,” “review-ready,” or “release
  candidate” must remain distinct from actual App Review acceptance.
- Do not call simulator, preview, compile, unit-test, signed-archive, or
  TestFlight evidence physical production proof. Name the device/build/task.
- Preserve cancellation, stale-revision, process termination, interruption,
  retry, revocation, deletion, recovery, accessibility, and offline/model-
  unavailable behavior.

## Open-source bundle boundary

This package is a seeded orchestrator for the future open-source bundle set. It
now has dedicated role packages for native design, on-device intelligence,
testing/release assurance, device/release proof, privacy/performance, and source
refresh/availability, but it is not evidence that the whole Apple SDK atlas is
complete. Before publishing a larger bundle set:

1. Keep each skill under the progressive-disclosure budget: concise core
   workflow in `SKILL.md`, detailed route material in one-level references.
2. Give every skill a precise trigger description, source-refresh contract,
   target/availability gates, output template, test/audit contract, and refusal
   boundaries.
3. Exercise the skills on representative app tasks and retain fixtures showing
   whether the LLM chose native APIs, preserved user intent, and separated
   evidence levels.
4. Validate/package each `.skill` artifact and inspect its contents before
   release. Do not publish generated bundles with secrets, stale private paths,
   or unverified Apple claims.
